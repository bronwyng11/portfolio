           <h2>Mole Mash Game</h2>
             <p>For this project my partners and I, Justin and Anika, created a game that would be both fun and difficult, leaving the player wanting more and more this game consists of a few holes, and "the mole". The player will go through a series of levels that get more and more challenging as you move up. The point of the game is for the player to be able to catch as many moles as possible,giving them more points,in a limited amount of time. As the player progresses throughout the game new features are added such as different colored mole, and incresased speed of the moles themselves. Overall the game should leave the player wanting more!

               <h2>Pot of Gold Game</h2>
                 <p>In this project I helped create with my partner Likhit. It has a great concept, and leaves the player wanting more. The point of the game is the player has to help the leprechaun find the pot of gold. As the levels progress new obstacles are added making it more difficult for the player to reach the pot of gold. The player can make the leprechaun jump and move from side to side. As you play, you are pulled into a world of darkness and goblins, it is your job to help the leprechaun get back to it's lovely pot of gold!

        <h2>About me!</h2>
       <p><div>Hi my name is Bronwyn Gordon, and I am a freshman in highschool. Throughout the short period of time I have been on this planet I have discovered a few of my passions. One of them is dance. I have been dancing since I was four, so I guess you can say I discovered one of my true loves at a fairly young age. I started off in a small studio that taught me how to step and pivot, I only grew from there.I started competitively dancing about five years ago, I’ve come a long way. Other things I enjoy doing include listening to music, hanging out with my family and friends, and trying out new recipes in the cookbook! I’ve always been a person full of curiosity, so I find it fun to try out new things constantly, especially if it’s delicious. I am a person that has been raised to try my hardest in everything I do, and that it’s okay to fail, as long as you keep trying. I try to keep this in mind in everything I do, whether it’s dance, school work, or anything else that may require me to work hard in. In my years to come I hope to keep on the road to success, and make it so that every day is a new adventure, and not just another day. Though I do not for sure know what I will be doing as my life career, I do know that I will work hard to ensure I’m on my way to the big time!
